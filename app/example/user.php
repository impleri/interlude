/* This extension pack is meant to provide developers a working guide as to how extensions interface with Interlude. Most of the files in this directory are loaded automatically by il when needed. I will provide detailed descriptions of the usage of each file as they relate to integration with the structures of il. They are meant to be self-contained within their directory, as this one is, in order to make upgrades and removals easier. */
