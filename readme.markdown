Interlude
=========

I'm resurrecting an old PHP project in the hopes that its existence here will help motivate me to work on it.

Most of the work has been conceptual, and those concepts have changed as internet technologies have evolved, but this project was never updated frequently enough. In some ways, it is still a relic of PHP back when OO programming and MVC structure were relatively uncommon in the popular PHP scripts. But that has not changed the conceptual aims of this project, only its implementation.
