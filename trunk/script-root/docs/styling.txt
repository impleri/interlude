##### Templates #####
A template should be generic enough to sustain different image schemes and css styles.  The 
index.html file is the primary layout which utilizes the modularity of Interlude to display
content dynamically.  All styles should include a a menu section, at least one sidebar
section, and a main content section.  The menu section can be created either vertically or
horizontally and can include sub-menus, but all of this is generated on-the-fly according to
options in the menu reference in a given template.  The sidebar section is also generated on-
the-fly, but must be vertical.  There can be multiple sidebars, but these are positioned by
the template (or by css if you choose).  The main content section is generated according to
the page being accessed.  It first goes through the template file hierarchy of the module that
is generating the content, then falls back to the default module and processes accordingly.
A good example is a forum module in which a user is attempting to view a topic: the process
for viewing a topic should specify a template file (such as forum_viewtopic.html).  If that
does not exist, the display engine will try to recover by falling back to the default display
of the forum module (such as an index page).  If that also fails, the system will fall back
to its default module (such as a splash page) with an error message.  Lastly, all primary
styling should follow the generic css outline in order to be compatible with multiple styles.
